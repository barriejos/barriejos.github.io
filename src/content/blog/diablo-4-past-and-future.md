description: A summary of my launch criticisms and the current future outlook.
---

During the launch of Diablo 4 I wrote down some thoughts on the state of the game and my criticisms of it for friends. Diablo 4 is going through the exact same thing Diablo 3 went through on launch in regards to itemization and endgame content. (You would think they learned from past mistakes)

In the recent "Campfire Chats" (state of the game sort of talks) we have been getting more and more info about their ["Loot Reborn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awvOopWqiHU) Season 4 which will fix a lot of the core issues I have with the game.

This entire update looks great on paper, and I think (and hope) it plays as well in practice as it sounds. I will probably not play Season 4 (my time is being sucked up by WoW and soon the new Final Fantasy XIV [expansion](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/)) but I will be diving headfirst into the Vessel of Hatred expansion.

For history's sake, I have rewritten my initial thoughts to be a bit less... aggressive and put them down below. I will put anecdotes on things I know have been improved, and will probably make another post after I have played Vessel of Hatred. Take note: I have not played since launch and only followed dev updates.

# Launch thoughts

## tl;dr

For a first time playthrough in my opinion this is the best Diablo **campaign** ever made, if you haven't played the glory days of Diablo 2.

I am personally biased, but it is much more likely I will play through the D2 campaign (for the thousandth time) again than D4. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. If you haven't played D2, you will probably agree D4 is the best.

Putting that aside, the campaign is amazing, story is good, music, atmosphere, all top notch. If that was all that existed this game would be amazing, but alas it's not.

## The meaty part

From the perspective of a necromancer that went from minion build to bone spear.

- Level scaling doesn't feel good. It actively works against you trying to get better gear and levels which contradicts the arpg power fantasy. - Has been somewhat improved
- The general idea behind itemization is pretty good, but it gets dragged down by an overload of useless and too complex affixes. This also results in a lot of tedious item sorting and lost time not playing the game. - This is being reworked in Season 4

- Dropped legendary powers are a cool idea, what's not cool is that they are one time use only which greatly restricts you in upgrading gear (hunting for the perfect rolls over and over and over again not wanting to use the best rolled ones) - This is being improved in Season 4

- I dislike the generator/spender mechanic (same as in D3 but this somehow feels worse) you feel powerful for a handful of casts and then go back to 0 damage for most of the time.

- All the things you unlock like waypoints, map exploration, renown (which is **very** important for character progression), dungeon aspects, etc. get reset with new seasons. I refuse to play this seasonally with renown grind. - This has been improved prior to Season 4

- Map exploration and waypoints besides a couple of the major cities get reset **on every new character even within the same season**. - This has been improved prior to Season 4

- There is a shared stash for your entire realm (the non-season realm or season realm and then divided into softcore and hardcore) with only 4 tabs **total**. I almost filled this up with 1 character. - This has been somewhat improved prior to Season 4

- A lot of standard quality of life is missing. No item filters, no search in stash/skill trees/world map, no overlay map. - This has been somewhat improved prior to Season 4

- The zoom level is too close up and unchangeable. - Is being somewhat improved in Season 4 (I think)

- Side quests are terribly designed. The indicators of what to do or where to go are flat out wrong a lot of times without giving indications in the quest text of what to do/where to go.

- Group play is extremely advantageous compared to solo play.

- The renown grind is mind numbingly boring and badly designed but required for character progression (Skill points/paragon points) - This is only needed once now luckily

- Riding your mount in open world is not fun. You get knocked off the horse often because of road blockades or mobs "scaring the horse". When you mount/dismount for whatever reason there is between 5 and 20 seconds of delay to remount. You get stuck on a lot of small stuff like rocks, pathing feels bad. - Has been somewhat improved prior to Season 4

- Popular (good) farm spots get nerfed, popular builds get nerfed (I hope they don't do this while a season is ongoing but at this point I wouldn't be surprised). Blizzard has been actively sucking the fun out of the game during launch and making the overall experience worse. This is generally done by reducing monster density, which feels extremely backwards in an arpg.

- There has been data mining of quality of life improvements for example more stash tabs that have been in the game from launch but not activated. I'm assuming they are going to make these available as rewards during the first season. Why make life more difficult for people playing now? Are they trying to encourage people to play the new season just to be able to play the game as a normal arpg? Do they expect people to just quit otherwise? Intentions unclear and feels scummy.

- They claim to have 100+ dungeons but in reality there is almost no boss variety in the dungeons, the tilesets are limited to the 4 regions and the layout itself is mostly identical.

- There are time-gating events inside the dungeons to prevent you from doing them "too fast" (no fun allowed) there is also close to no variety in these events and are just blatant stop gaps to make you go even slower. - This has been somewhat improved prior to Season 4 (I think)

- The objectives to complete inside dungeons are boring, have close to no variety, and there is one specific objective "Kill all monsters" that makes me cringe the moment I see it on the screen. Got one straggler? Better go find it!

- I (almost) can't believe I'm saying this but D3 rifts were infinitely more fun than D4 dungeons from a gameplay perspective. - This is being improved with "The Pit" which is inspired by Greater Rifts from D3 being added in Season 4

- I don't think Blizzard even knows what game they are trying to make with D4, it's a weird MMO/ARPG hybrid but it's failing in both categories. There are a lot of design decisions that make me question if they even have arpg players in their dev team. - This has been improved with a multitude of changes, the vision looks more clear now. Campfire Chats have also revealed their way of thinking behind some of these decisions which aren't inherently bad.

## Conclusion

### Past conclusion

I would recommend D4 if you like the Diablo lore and atmosphere, the campaign is amazing. If you are looking for an arpg with good endgame, this isn't it. There are many more and way better options available and coming (Path Of Exile (2), Last Epoch, Torchlight Infinite, Grim Dawn, Torchlight 2, Titan Quest, Diablo 2 (Resurrected), ...)

I myself will not be returning to D4 unless there are story updates/expansion packs or they do a 180 degree shift in direction of the game. I can't even be bothered leveling alts.

So did I have fun? Yeah, the entire campaign and discovering the endgame. At this point I have lost confidence Blizzard knows how to make good multiplayer games.

### Added onto conclusion now

That last bit about losing confidence they know how to make multiplayer games has been kind of revoked for me. I have been having a lot of fun in WoW, and the next expansion The War Within seems to add and improve upon the fun base foundation they have laid in Dragonflight.

The D4 dev updates I have listened to and read also suggest they are listening to feedback and improving most of the concerns with D4 endgame.

Now hopefully Starcraft (as a franchise) and Warcraft 3 will receive the same treatment, but I doubt it.
