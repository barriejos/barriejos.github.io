I've been wanting to tackle my backlog for years now, and I have slowly started getting around to it. The way I am going about it is partly inspired by Daryl Talks Games's attempt on it: [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgAlnDIPMU), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuszSUI_qBY).

To start off, my definition of a backlog is games that I already own but have not played. Some people also include games they want to play but do not own, that's separate for me.

The "Backlog Diaries" series will not only include titles that are in my "backlog" but also titles that release and I play immediately. When the backlog is done I will rename the series to "What I've been playing" or something along those lines.

Through this journey I have started to understand which genres of games I like more than others. I like a lot of genres, but I have noticed some mechanics in general I just really don't like, like deck building.

This is not only an effort to get through my backlog, but also to play more single player games I actually want to. I have noticed myself playing live service games beyond the point of personal enjoyment, which is a habit I want to get rid of. Play games because I enjoy them, and play more diverse quality single player games.

Adding to that, I am sick of all the generic live service games, battle passes, content locked behind pre orders or launch dlc and all the other crap that is so prevalent in the industry. I am very critical in picking live service games I do play/want to support.

Some personal rules I have set for myself:

- Give every game a fair shot.
- If I don't enjoy something, drop it quicker instead of grinding through because "it might get better a lot of people like this so I should too".
- Limit the amount of "live service games" I am playing at any time/yearly basis. Not only because they take up a lot of time, but because at a certain point I keep playing some of them out of habit or perceived "work mentality" instead of enjoyment.

There are also games in my backlog that I have already finished, but want to replay. Or games that I feel I haven't given a fair shot many years ago and want to retry.

After cutting out the least interesting looking games from the list, I have 246 entries remaining.

I will post updates with small descriptions of what I thought about each game as I progress.
